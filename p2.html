      <p>
       This is a ps5.js sketch that I created using a short description of my partner allyson's lost stuffed cat.

      <h2>
      The Description
      </h2>
      <p>
It was a black and white kitten stuffed animal that was white with black patches. It had a white belly and a light pink nose + ears with green eyes. It was pretty fluffy with longish whiskers and a tail? With little paws. I think the eyes were embroidered or glossy, but there was a sparkle in its eyes. You could hold it in your arms?

      <p>
        As I continue to use p5.js things are begining to become easier and easier, I feel like I was really able to match the description that Allyson gave me pretty reasonably, and it feels my troubleshooting when running into issues has begun to evolve to an extent.
